a ghastly monotony not to be found in the the weird skeleton rattled along the streets before and struck but it was never at the pains of assuming a it played on no dulcimer was crowned with no waved no minced in no flowing robe or lifted no sat at no cast no counted no it was simply a famished slaying his way the borders of ratcliff and eastward of and giving on the impure were the scene of this uncompromising dance of upon a drizzling november a squalid maze of and alleys of miserable houses let out in single a wilderness of and a chiefly inhabited by a tribe from whom employment has or to whom it comes but fitfully and they are not skilled mechanics in any they are but hewers of wood and drawers of but they have come into and they propagate their wretched one grisly joke the skeleton seemed to play off it had stuck on the which the wind and rain had deteriorated into suitable it had even summed up the state of the in on the shutters of one ruined it adjured the free and independent starvers to vote for thisman and vote for not to as they valued the state of parties and the national prosperity of great importance to i by returning thisman and each naught without the

staying the physical and of many thousands shall say how of the english for devising employment useful to the community for those who want but to work and for equalising cultivating waste facilitating above all saving and utilising the oncoming and thereby changing national weakness into pondering in my i these hopeful i turned down a narrow street to look into a house or it was a dark street with a dead wall on one nearly all the outer doors of the houses stood i took the first and knocked at a might i come i if i the woman of the room had picked up some long strips of about some wharf or and they had just now been thrust into the otherwise empty grate to make two iron pots there was some fish in and there were some potatoes in the the flare of the burning wood enabled me to see a and a broken chair or and some old cheap crockery ornaments about the it was not until i had spoken with the woman a few that i saw a horrible brown heap on the floor in a but for previous experience in this dismal i might not have suspected to be there was something thrown upon and i asked what that the poor craythur that stays and very bad she and very bad been this long and better never and slape she does all and wake she does all and the sure the where the women gets took on at a when they makes application early and is lucky and and she and some of them gets and some of them gets and but not and all according to the and some constitooshuns is and some is and her constitooshun is bad as can and her brain is coming out at her and it hurts her and what it and niver no and niver no the sick young woman moaning the speaker bent over took a bandage from her and threw open a back door to let in the daylight upon from the smallest and most miserable backyard i ever what cooms from being and it cooms from her night and the sick and the pain of it is and god he knows that my husband has walked the sthreets these four being a and is walking them and is ready to and no work for and no fire and no food but the bit in the and no more than ten shillings in a god be good to and it is poor we and dark it is and could it is knowing that i could compensate myself thereafter for my if i saw i had resolved that i would give nothing in the course of these i did this to try the i may state at once that my closest observation could not detect any indication whatever of an expectation that i would give they were grateful to be talked to about their miserable and sympathy was plainly a comfort to but they neither asked for money in any nor showed the least trace of surprise or disappointment or resentment at my giving the married daughter had by this time come down from her room on the floor to join in the she herself had been to the very early that morning to be but had not she had four and her also a and then out seeking seemed in no better case as to finding it than her she was and by of a buxom figure and both in her poor dress and in her there was an effort to keep up some appearance of she knew all about the sufferings of the unfortunate and all about the and how the symptoms came and how they often seen the very smell when you stood inside the door of the works was enough to knock you she yet she was going back again to get what could she better be ulcerated and paralysed for a while it than see the children a dark and squalid cupboard in this touching the back door and all manner of had been for some time the of the sick young but the nights being now and the blankets and coverlets to the leaving she lay all night where she lay all and was lying the woman of the her this most miserable and two lay on the one brown heap together for bless and thank were the parting words from these spoken which i left this some streets i tapped at another on another looking i found a his and four sitting at a by way of at their dinner of bread and infused there was a very scanty cinderous fire in the grate by which they and there was a tent bedstead in the room with a bed upon it and a the man did not rise when i went nor during my but civilly inclined his head on my pulling off my in answer to my inquiry whether i might ask him a question or there being a window at each end of this back and it might have been but it was shut up to keep the cold and was very the an congress shall make no law frank zappa thank you very much for being with please my name is frank this is my attorney larry stein from los can you hear could if you could speak very directly and clearly into the i would appreciate my name is frank this is my attorney larry the statement that i that i sent you copies is five pages so i have shortened it down and going to read a condensed version of certain things have i have been listening to the event in the other room and have heard some conflicting reports as to whether or not people in this committee want i understand that hollings does from his is that i think you better concentrate on your rather than asking questions to the the reason i need to ask because i have to change something in my testimony if there is not a clearcut version of whether or not legislation is what is being discussed do the best you because i think anybody here can characterize senator i will carry on with the first thing senator i might help him out just a little i might make a senator this is one senator that might be interested in legislation regulation to some recognizing the problems with free right of expression and my previously expressed views that i believe i should be telling other people what they have to listen but i really believe that the suggestion made by the original panel was some kind of an arrangement for voluntarily policing this in the music industry as the correct way to if help you out in your i might join senator hollings or others in some kind of legislation unless the free enterprise both the producers and you as the see fit to clean up your thank senator hardly the first thing i would like to because i know there is some foreign press involved here and they might not understand what the issue is one of the things the issue is about is the first amendment to the and it is short and i would like to read it so they will it shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of for these are my personal observations and i speak on behalf of no group or professional the pmrc proposal is an piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to infringes the civil liberties of people who are not and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the my understanding that in law first amendment issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive in this the pmrc demands are the equivalent of treating dandruff by no one has forced baker or gore to bring prince or sheena easton into their thanks to the they are free to buy other forms of music for their they insist on purchasing the works of contemporary recording artists in order to support a personal illusion of aerobic please be the purchase price does not entitle you to a kiss on the foot from the composer or performer in exchange for a spin on the family taken as a the complete list of pmrc demands reads like an instruction manual for some sinister kind of toilet training program to all composers and performers because of the lyrics of a how dare the shame must be shared by the bosses at the major labels through the chose to bargain away the rights of and retailers in order to pass the blank tape a private tax levied by an industry on consumers for the benefit of a select group within that is this a consumer you bet it the major record labels need to have whiz through a few committees before anybody smells a one of them is chaired by senator is it a coincidence that thurmond is affiliated with the i say a because the pmrc has no their secretary told me on the phone last friday that the pmrc has no only i asked how many other wives are nonmembers of an organization that raises money by has a and seems intent on running the constitution of the united states through the family i asked her if it was a she said she give me an answer and that she had to call their while the wife of the secretary of the treasury drive my love inside and senator wife talks about and sex at on the cbs evening people in high places work on a tax bill that is so the only way to sneak it through is to keep the mind on something porn is the basic issue is it mental is it an issue at the pmrc has created a lot of confusion with improper comparisons between song record radio and live these are all different mediums and the people who work in them have the right to conduct their business without whipped up like an instant pudding by wives of big is it proper that the husband of a pmrc sits on any committee considering business pertaining to the blank tape tax or his lobbying can any committee thus constituted find facts in a fair and unbiased this committee has three that we know senator senator and senator for some they seem to feel there is no conflict of interest children in the vulnerable age bracket have a natural love for if as a parent you believe they should be exposed to something more uplifting than support music appreciation programs in why you considered your need for consumer music appreciation costs very little compared to sports your children have a right to know that something besides pop music lt is unfortunate that the pmrc would rather dispense governmentally sanitized heavy metal music than something more is this an indication of personal taste or just another manifestation of the low priority this administration has placed on education for the arts in the of is you distract people from thinking about an unfair tax by talking about music for that you need and lots of the establishment of a rating voluntary or opens the door to an endless parade of moral quality control programs based on things certain christians what if the next bunch of washington wives demands a large yellow on all material written or performed by in order to save helpless children from exposure to concealed zionist record ratings are frequently compared to film apart from the quantitative there is another that is more people who act in films are hired to no matter how the film is it when calling you will you answer that means i offer my life to you to be my own if you refuse me i will be waiting all alone but if when you hear my love call ringing clear and i hear your answering echo

yesterday those happy hours that we once knew though long ago they still make me blue they say that time heals a broken heart but time has stood still since been apart the elections of are described

the democrats have to achieve the shared goal of all elite and leadership to jobs for and win security and freedom for the and they will take over and successfully lead the crusade to establish the american dream of free market one of the great achievements of contemporary ideological warfare has been to debase the terms of political discourse so thoroughly that such statements as these are not entirely if we keep to what has become conventional as orwell this achievement has undermined the possibility even of talking sensibly about what is happening in the independent minds including any authentic conservatives who might be located in the outer reaches of the political arena or intellectual world can refuse to be swept up in the fashionable currents and use terms with their actual meanings to describe what is and the triumph of conservatism most of we also heard just ten years when reagan was elected by a the second in four in his presidential historian william leuchtenberg far

the part of the general their concerns and desires were not articulated in the political one why voting was so sharply skewed towards privileged the reasons why voting is so dramatically an elite
